## How to run right now
```
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
npm run check                              # lint, format, typecheck, unit tests, build
npm run e2e                                # Playwright smoke test

cd backend && make install && make dev     # http://localhost:8000/health, /docs
make check                                 # ruff, pytest

docker compose up --build                  # frontend :8080, backend :8000
```

## Known issues
- Claude in Chrome: console reading works (clean), but script injection for screenshots and page reads times out on the Vite dev page in this session ("Page still loading"). Playwright is the gate and produces the committed screenshots; the Chrome pass is retried each UI phase.
